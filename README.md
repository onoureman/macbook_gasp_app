## ✨ Overview

This project is a **3D Apple MacBook landing page** inspired by Apple’s design style.  
It combines smooth scroll animations, GSAP timelines, and 3D product interactions using Three.js.  
I built it to strengthen my React and front-end animation skills while experimenting with modern web motion design.
